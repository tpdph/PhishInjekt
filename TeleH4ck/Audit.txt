2. **Advanced Payload Generation:**
    *   Develop a more sophisticated payload generation module that can create custom payloads tailored to specific targets and objectives. This could involve using techniques like polymorphism and obfuscation to evade detection.
3. **Stealth and Evasion:**
    *   Incorporate techniques to enhance stealth and evade detection, such as using encryption, steganography, and process injection.
4. **Integration with other tools:**
    *   Integrate with other penetration testing tools, such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Burp Suite, to create a more comprehensive and powerful toolkit.
5. **Cloud Integration:**
    *   Add support for cloud-based deployment and execution, allowing for remote control and monitoring of the tool.
6. **AI-Powered Features:**
    *   Incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to automate tasks, improve decision-making, and enhance the overall effectiveness of the tool. For example, AI could be used to analyze network traffic, identify patterns, and predict future attacks.
